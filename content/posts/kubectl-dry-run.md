![kubectl --dry-run=client](/static_en/kubectl-dry-run.png)

On day-to-day operations in Kubernetes, I find myself frequently using the kubectl flag `--dry-run=client`. I use it to generate definitions of objects in yaml by pairing it with `-o yaml`. For example:

```bash
kubectl run test --image busybox --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: test
  name: test
spec:
  containers:
  - image: busybox
    name: test
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```

I learned this flag while studying for [CKAD certification](https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/), and it was handy for the exam. However, I found it verbose at the time. ‚ÄúWhy couldn‚Äôt I just pass `--dry-run`?‚Äù I thought. ü§î There were other arguments: `none` and `server`. I didn‚Äôt dive in much and either used the `client` argument or didn‚Äôt specify the flag.

Fast forward to today, while watching the session *The Hitchhiker's Guide to Pod Security* by [Lachlan Evenson](https://twitter.com/LachlanEvenson) in KubeCon EU 2022, I found the usage of `--dry-run` but this time with `server` argument! ü§Ø And it finally makes sense.

# none, client and server

`--dry-run` supports three values. The help states the following:

```
--dry-run='none':
	Must be "none", "server", or "client". If client strategy, only print the object that would be sent, without
	sending it. If server strategy, submit server-side request without persisting the resource.
```

## server

In Lachlan‚Äôs talk, he uses the `server` argument and not the `client` one. Why? Because he wants to validate his object against the [Pod Security](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/) admission controller[^1]. That‚Äôs only possible if a request to the kube-apiserver goes through the typical stages up until persisting in storage.

[^1]: You can read more about [admission controllers](https://nunoadrego.com/posts/opa-gatekeeper-in-the-admission-controllers-world/#kubernetes-admission-controllers) in my previous post.

Let‚Äôs repeat the same command I ran before, but this time with the `server` argument:

```bash
kubectl run test --image busybox --dry-run=server -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2022-05-22T13:06:26Z"
  labels:
    run: test
  name: test
  namespace: default
  uid: c85d8c20-5a6d-4e40-8211-63bf08dea293
spec:
  containers:
  - image: busybox
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    name: test
    resources: {}
    terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
    terminationMessagePolicy: File
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount
      name: kube-api-access-9j4wv
      readOnly: true
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  enableServiceLinks: true
  preemptionPolicy: PreemptLowerPriority
  priority: 0
  restartPolicy: Always
  schedulerName: default-scheduler
  securityContext: {}

  serviceAccountName: default

    tolerationSeconds: 300
  - effect: NoExecute
    key: node.kubernetes.io/unreachable
    operator: Exists
    tolerationSeconds: 300
  volumes:
  - name: kube-api-access-9j4wv
    projected:
      defaultMode: 420
      sources:
      - serviceAccountToken:
          expirationSeconds: 3607
          path: token
      - configMap:
          items:
          - key: ca.crt
            path: ca.crt
          name: kube-root-ca.crt
      - downwardAPI:
          items:
          - fieldRef:
              apiVersion: v1
              fieldPath: metadata.namespace
            path: namespace
status:
  phase: Pending
  qosClass: BestEffort
```

As we can see, there is a lot more information, and it is similar to what we would persist if we created the resource without a dry run.

## client

On the other hand, with the `client` argument, commands print the object's definition, and there are no admission validations or mutations made to it.

Does this mean that whith this argument the command doesn‚Äôt communicate with the kube-apiserver at all? ü§î Let's find out!

```bash
unset KUBECONFIG
kubectl run test --image busybox --dry-run=client -o yaml
The connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?
```

Oops. It seems we can‚Äôt use `client` argument without a kubeconfig/context set.

Now with a cluster running with kubeconfig and context set, let's try to create a Service to expose a Deployment that does not exist:

```bash
kubectl expose deploy test --dry-run=client -o yaml
Error from server (NotFound): deployments.apps "test" not found
```

No luck. Before generating the yaml for the Service, kubectl asks the kube-apiserver if the given Deployment we want to expose exists. I think we are convinced now.

Furthermore, I found that the result of `--dry-run=client` is used when we opt for `--dry-run=server`. We can observe this by increasing the [verbosity level of kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#kubectl-output-verbosity-and-debugging).

```bash
kubectl -v 8 run test --image busybox --dry-run=server -o yaml
```

```bash

Check the `Request Body` of the truncated output. Sounds familiar, right? üòõ

## none

Finally, `none` is like not using the flag at all, meaning it‚Äôs not a dry run, and the request will be made and persisted if it succeeds.

# **Summarising**

To generate objects' definitions from commands like `kubectl run`, `kubectl expose`, `kubectl create namespace`, or others, use `--dry-run=client`.

To validate or observe mutations done by admission controllers and get more sense of how a given object would be stored, use `--dry-run=server`.

Lastly, if we don‚Äôt want to do a dry run, we can either use `--dry-run=none` or do not pass the flag.
